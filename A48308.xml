         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:64411:4"/>from you, ſince to many of you a good part of what I ſhall ſay is very well knowne: and that with the reſt I ſhall reduce to theſe foure particulars; whereof, moſt as yet have either none, or at leaſt but a doubtfull apprehenſion: and wherein it is meet they ſhould be rightly informed.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Concerning the occaſion of the diſcourſe enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The preſenting of it at firſt to you; and then to him, to whom it is inſcribed.</p>

            <p n="4">4. The Reaſons, why now I am willing to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate Copies of it, which before I was not.</p>
            <p>Firſt, for the Occaſion, it was this: Some of you, and divers others (my ſelfe for one) met at W. at the monethly Exerciſe ſet up, or upheld (as is confidently delivered by divers perſons of unqueſtionable credit) with the good liking and allowance of our late lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Soveraigne, as a godly and gratefull memoriall of his Majeſties, and the Kingdomes deliverance from the Powder Treaſon.</p>
            <p>At one of the Aſſemblies there, the Biſhop of <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> that now is, not long before hee was advanced to the Epiſcopall Chaire, beſtowed his paines in the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit one part of the day, and I mine the other. At our premiſed meeting, which was Auguſt 18. laſt paſt, the ſervice of the day was divided betwixt you (M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Ch. H.</hi>) and mee, and our minds and tongues united in preſſing <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> moſt needfull Themes for theſe cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zie and diſtracted times.</p>
            <p>Our Sermons ended, and ſome of us invited to a
<pb facs="tcp:64411:5"/>place of convenient repoſe, the reſt of our Tribe (who were a part of that Congregation) reſorted unto us, every man accompanying his acquaintance, and ſo making, as it were, a whole chaine of many linkes; and withall, it is not unlike, but that the moſt that there met in perſon, met alſo in perplexity of mind, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the late Canonicall Oath, and in their deſires to be reſolved of their Doubts: and they might have ſo much more hope thereof, as there were the more at that time, with whom, in ſuch caſes of conſcience they might conſult.</p>
            <p>Howſoever, being ſo met, that which was the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon talke of the Laity, and the particular trouble of the Clergy, could not but be a principall part of our diſcourſe at that time; and of that, the moſt that was ſaid, was the propoſall of a Doubt, <hi>Whether the Oath were doubtfull, or no?</hi> and all of us expreſſing but the ſame conceipt (as I verily beleeve) which every one brought with him, unanimouſly conſented in an Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative anſwer.</p>
            <p>Our next <hi>Quaere</hi> was, what courſe ſhould be taken, either that we might not take it, or that it might be ſo cleared and qualified unto us, that our conſciences might not be entangled by it; and for that, wee reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to propoſe our Doubts of the Oath to the Biſhop of the Dioceſſe, and by him to advance higher (though in the low and humble way of Petition) if there were cauſe. Then the Queſtion was, Who ſhould draw up our deſires and doubts in writing; and the company aſſembled, preſently agreed to put that taske upon me, which I then undertooke.</p>
            <p>This was the worſt of that daies work, which ſome
<pb facs="tcp:64411:5"/>(whoſe place and profeſſion promiſed more charity and diſcretion) have ſlandered, as a Schiſmaticall Conventicle, and a ſeditious Aſſembly; and have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to their calumnies of us, comminations of the higheſt diſpleaſure, and danger againſt us.</p>
            <p>To what height would they have raiſed their indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation towards us, if wee ſhould have met of purpoſe to make a common purſe to maintaine our cauſe, as the<note n="a" place="margin">Biſh. <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wins</hi> Catal. of Biſhops <hi>p.</hi> 116.</note> Clergy in <hi>Henry</hi> the thirds time did, againſt <hi>Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi> Archbiſhop of Canterbury: or, ſhould have burnt the new booke of Canons, as<note n="b" place="margin">Hiſt. of the Councell of Trent. <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 12</note> 
               <hi>Luther</hi> did the Popes Bull and Decretalls; when a meeting, in it ſelfe ſo faultleſſe and inoffenſive, is racked, to make it reach to the height of an hainous crime.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond particular is the preſenting of that, which upon the requeſt of my Brethren I had perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: firſt, unto them; which I did the next Exerciſe after: (notwithſtanding my burthen of other buſineſſe betwixt them both) and received from them ſuch an atteſtation and acceptance, upon the reading thereof, as I may well take for a recompence of greater paines then it coſt mee; and which may embolden mee to adventure it upon the view of other eyes, then of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed friends. From my Brethren of the Presbytery, it was next to be a graduate to the Biſhop of <hi>Cheſter:</hi> But while that was in deliberation <hi>[when, and by whom to be done]</hi> I was informed, that a Letter was written by the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> to other Biſhops, both of this, and the other Province, not to preſſe the Oath upon any, untill the 13. of October: and for that time it was reſolved by ſome of us (to whoſe diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:64411:6"/>ſuch conſiderations were referred) it ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved.</p>
            <p>Meane while, we had aſſured newes of a Parliament ſhortly to enſue: That (as many of us then conceived) ſo varied the caſe, that it invited us to betake our ſelves to another courſe then wee intended before; and then it was thought fit, neither ſo to ſolicite the Biſhop, as if wee did principally depend upon his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour for our freedome from the Oath; nor yet ſo to paſſe by him, as to give cauſe of ſuſpition, that he was ſlighted by us: and therefore about the 14. of October I brought him the Booke at firſt, eſpecially prepared for his reading; which I told him, I tendred not to him then as an Agent for the Clergy, but as of mine owne private and particular reſpect unto my Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan: which was ſuch, that I would not conſent (though much importuned) that any ſhould have a Copie of what I had compoſed, untill it were firſt offered to his peruſall, for which it was at firſt intended, and by joynt conſent concluded among us.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, for the addition now made to it, I may ſay truly, and ſome of my Brethren can teſtifie with mee, that the moſt of it was penned before any part of it was ſent to the ſight and cenſure of the Miniſters at W. and I therefore kept backe divers ſheets of it of purpoſe, that it might not be too long for their leiſure, at their firſt meeting (after it was finiſhed) to reade it together.</p>
            <p>And now, ſince upon notice of more they will not reſt content with a part, leſt they ſhould ſort mee to<note n="c" place="margin">Act 5.3.</note> 
               <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphyra</hi> (for a ſacrilegious detention)
<pb facs="tcp:64411:6"/>I am reſolved to communicate the whole firſt unto you, and then by you unto others.</p>
            <p>And for this I am now in the fourth place to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſome Reaſons; and they are chiefly theſe:</p>
            <p>Firſt, to gratifie my Brethren and Friends, who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunately preſſe mee, to make them partakers of my private Dictates concerning the Oath.</p>
            <p>Secondly, to juſtifie our refuſall of it, which ſome have ſuperciliouſly cenſured, as proceeding of ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city; and ſome uncharitably, as ſavouring of contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, or of hypocriſie: as if wee did but pretend a tenderneſſe of conſcience; and therefore that wee would be ſure to take it, rather then ſuffer any thing for ſtanding out againſt it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, to rectifie the miſtaking of divers tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts of my Booke from the firſt Copy (which are ſpread abroad in many places, either without my knowledge, or againſt my will) ſome whereof I have ſeen, and by them have found out a double falſhood: the one of theft, in ſtealing of Copies (without my conſent) the other of lying, in putting their ignorant or curſory ſlips upon mine accompt, as if I had made them.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, to cleare the doubt of ſome, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute the miſ-report of others, who give out, that I am the Author of a Booke intituled, <hi>Englands complaint to Jeſus Christ againſt the Biſhops Canons;</hi> wherein I was a meere ſtranger, for the matter of it (untill I ſaw it in print) and am yet for the maker of it now it is printed; and though ſuch as well know mee, will no more beleeve it to bee mine, then mine<note n="d" place="margin">

<pb facs="tcp:64411:7"/>fraudulent forgery, and I might ſay impudent alſo: for, what impudence was it to impoſe ſuch a diſcourſe upon his Fatherhood, a perſon ſo well, ſo generally knowne, and not more knowne, then honoured throughout the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian world, and yet not by death tranſlated to another life, but alive and lively, in very good health, nor (for the preſent) at a remote diſtance in Ireland, but in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, in London, where hee might be ſure to be ſoone in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of the wrong, and find a ready way to right him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe?</hi> 
               <q>Which may be a conſiderable occaſion and motive, to all men of eminent Abilities (of whoſe worth the world hath taken notice by their workes) to leave a perfect Regiſter of the legitimate iſſue of their ingenious and ſtudious conceptions (intended and prepared for publicke uſe) that when they are dead, no ſuppoſitious brats may bee thruſt in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, to claime a childes part of their fathers reputation.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude (for, this ſhort digreſſion ended) I have done with this Introductory Diſcourſe: If while I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to avoid the inconveniences fore-mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, I expoſe my ſelfe (by a more generall view of this diſcuſſion of the Oath) to more variety of cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, which from ſome are like to bee ſevere enough (for ſuch as have thought us worthy to be undone, if wee dare not ſweare, no doubt will entertaine theſe Doubts and Reaſons with diſtaſte) I ſhall not need any other cordiall againſt their miſ-conceits, then to reflect firſt upon the integrity of mine intentions, and the fidelity of my performance of this ſervice; and then upon the conſiderate ſubſcriptions of ſuch unto it, as

            <head>A Preface to the READER, written by <hi>N. E.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>Shewing that the Book (concerning the Oath, decreed in the ſixth Canon of the late Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod) as it was penned in good ſeaſon; ſo it is now publiſhed not out of ſeaſon: ſince it is yet of good uſe, to divers purpoſes, of great and permanent importance, when both the Oath and Penalty be wholly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed.</p>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen the Authour of this enſuing Treatiſe compoſed it, there was (by reaſon of the new enjoyned Oath) much doubt and diſtraction among many godly and learned Miniſters; and (for their ſakes) among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple alſo, whereto theſe Doubts, and Hopes, and Reaſons miniſtred a ſeaſonable remedy: for, the Doubts put many out of doubt, that the Oath, as it was framed, was to be refuſed: the Hopes (for all that) upheld the heart againſt deſpaire of ſafety, from the commination of the Canon; and the Reaſons gave ſupport unto them both: and all together (with the
<pb facs="tcp:64411:9"/>learned ingenuity and pious modeſty, diffuſed through the whole frame and ſtile of the worke) have ſo taken the hearts of divers Divines of eminent note (for their good parts and great paines in their holy callings, among whom were ſome, whoſe dignity in the Church was by the Canon to be ſecured from altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) as to obtaine their hands, for ſubſcription unto it; and to cauſe both them and many more to importune the publication of the Book (though the Oath it ſelfe, and Penalty annexed to it, were diſanulled) ſince the <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> of it are both of that kind, which may at any time entertaine a diſcreet and religious Reader with profit and delight.</p>
            <p>For firſt, albeit the Oath gave the motive to it, yet it is not the Oath that makes the meaſure of it: for (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that) it compriſeth many very obſervable mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, concerning the purity of Religion (without mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Idolatry) the duties of Chriſtianity, the predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minance of Prelates, and priviledges of Presbyters, with many other particulars of moment, worthy of the publicke view, if that ſo offenſive, and (in reſpect of ſome I may ſay) formidable Canon, had never beene made.</p>
            <p>And for the Oath it ſelfe, this Booke will preſent unto the Reader very many conſiderable advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which no diſtance of time will put out of date: Concerning</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>the Synod of Divines, by whom the Canon was decreed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>thoſe by whom it was diſliked, when it was knowne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>their freedome from it, who were in danger by it.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:64411:10"/>
            <p>Firſt, for the Synod of Divines, the many &amp; weighty exceptions againſt the Oath, give juſt reaſon to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, that it was not framed by common conſultation among them, but deviſed by ſome one, or ſome few (at the moſt) who over-awed the reſt, and ſo obtruded it upon them, without their good liking; though great feare of oppoſing, and little hope of prevailing; which held them from making any open reſiſtance againſt it.</p>
            <p>To this purpoſe hath ſomething been ſaid on both ſides: for, on the one, it was told by a Favourite of a man of great power in the Synod (as in praiſe of his prudence) that hee compoſed the Canons before the Clergy aſſembled: and on the other ſide (which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the ſecond particular, and leads us to it) ſome of the Synod have profeſſed ſo much diſlike of that Canon of the Oath, that had it been in their power to ſuppreſſe it, it ſhould never have proceeded beyond the breath that firſt put it forth.</p>
            <p>And for the learned and pious Compoſer of theſe animadverſions upon it, though hee were a Clerke of the Convocation at Yorke, he never heard of it, untill it had obtained its finall approbation, both in that and the other Province; wherein yet hee was not wanting for the uſe of fit meanes, for his due information: for knowing that the Aſſembly at London was the Diall, that at Yorke but the Clocke, which was uſually ſet and regulated by it: preſently after his returne from the firſt Seſſion at Yorke, hee addreſſed himſelfe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards London for intelligence at the firſt hand, that when the Canons were tranſmitted thither, hee might be ſufficiently inſtructed (upon good grounds) to give or deny his aſſent unto them: and ſo to doe either, that
<pb facs="tcp:64411:10"/>he might not be alone in that choice, whereto his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience did encline him.</p>
            <p>But being on his journie, hee was confidently certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied (by the way) that the Parliament was diſſolved, and with that hee conceived, both the Convocation and his Clerkſhip were expired: and therefore that he was diſcharged of further care and paines for ſuch a purpoſe; and if the cauſe had not been carried more by the power of ſome few, then the approbation of moſt, it might be matter of very great marvell, that ſo many, ſo great Clerkes ſhould give their aſſents to a thing (to bee aſſur'd upon Oath) which is ſo many waies ſubject to doubtfull conſtruction.</p>
            <p>And this may bee a juſt ground to all judicious and conſcionable Divines, to deſire a Synod of another Conſtitution; wherein there may be more freedome, for diſcuſſion and determination of Eccleſiaſticall matters, then was in that, or can be expected in any of that kind.</p>
            <p>Beſides ſuch as were members of Provinciall meetings, there were many more who were offended at the Oath, not only thoſe who were affrighted with the penalty (eſpecially the moſt conſcionable Clergy) but many of the Laity (of the beſt ſort and higheſt rank) have petitioned, pleaded, and, as it is now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly reported, the Honourable Houſe of Commons have voted it downe (though the right Honourable Lords of the Upper Houſe have not yet ſo far decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their judgements againſt it.)</p>
            <p>To theſe this booke may doe ſome acceptable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, as a juſt and complete Apology againſt that Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, which decrees for it, and ſo ſeverely threatens the
<pb facs="tcp:64411:11"/>refuſall of it) and againſt them, who ſo far favour it, as to referre all the Doubts and Quaeres about it, and Reaſons againſt it, rather to perverſe prejudice of thoſe that find fault with it, then to any juſt cauſe of excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Oath it ſelfe: adding with great confidence in it, and no leſſe contempt of ſuch as condemn'd it, that, <hi>If any of the Apoſtles, yea, or Chriſt himſelfe had penned it</hi> (a ſuppoſition of meere impoſſibility) <hi>ſuch men would yet have been cavilling againſt it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I can name the man that ſaid it, &amp; ſom what elſe (not much better to the ſame effect) and it may be an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy likewiſe for ſuch as diſlike it, againſt thoſe who have taken upon them by writing to defend it, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining nothing in it, that may offend the conſcience (if the judgement be not too weake, or the paſſion too ſtrong) whoſe papers have been too paſſent, and too much prevailed with ſome, who have not ſeene this diſcourſe, wherein the Author diſcovers their gloſſes upon it to bee but as the gildings of a rotten Nutmeg, though he forbeare their names, out of reſpect unto the common peace, and to their reputations in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, who muſt needs ſuffer with it, ſo far as they are oppoſed as Apologiſts for it: ſince as one of them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged (in the beginning of his anſwer to the Quaeres of the Miniſters of London) <hi>that the noiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Oath grew every day lowder and lowder, and that it was loaded with publicke and popular infamy:</hi> and ſo it is like hee ſhould have more need of pardon (as for a preſumptuous undertaking in that cauſe, being but a private perſon) then that he could bring ſufficient aide to juſtifie the Oath, which (not without juſt cauſe) had incurr'd ſo much condemnation.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:64411:11"/>
            <p>Thirdly, if we conſider their freedome from it, who were in danger by it &amp; they were <hi>many good Miniſters,</hi> who (if the ſwearing Canon had continued in force) muſt have ſuffred loſſe of their liberty, and livelihood; and <hi>very many good people,</hi> who were like to be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of their loving and laborious Miniſters) this Book may be of very good uſe, as a ready memoriall of ſuch a mercy to them all, as cannot bee forgotten, without wicked ingratitude: firſt to God, and next to thoſe worthy and honourable perſons, who have been the patrons of their preſent comfort, and protectours of them from the preſſure of this rigorous innovation: and unworthy were they (ſurely) of ſo great a favour, if they ſhould thinke, that when the Oath is condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, they are forthwith diſcharged from any farther thought or conſideration upon it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For mine owne part,</hi> ſaid a worthy Divine (and I am of his mind) <hi>I ſhall endeavour alwaies to keep ſuch an impreſsion both of the perill and diſappointment of the project, for which the Canon was contrived, that the</hi>

                     <hi>that it is not fufficient to beget a confidence, in this caſe to ſay we beleeve the Scriptures, and the Creeds, he returneth him this anſwer:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But if wee ſay it, you are bound in charity to beleeve us; for I know no other proofe of faith, but confeſsion of it, and ſubſcription to it: and for theſe particulars, wee have made the one, and done the other; ſo it is no bare ſaying, but you have all the proofe that can bee had, or that ever any Church required.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If his Lordſhip had remembred this, at the late Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, it may be he would not have thought it meet to require us to ſweare beyond our confeſſion and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription formerly made; for why ſhould hee, or the reſt of the Synod, have leſſe faith and charity to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine our teſtification, then we may juſtly expect from our Popiſh oppoſites, or require more of us then any Church ever did hitherto?</p>
                  <p>Long before theſe Canons were ſet forth, and<note n="h" place="margin">Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſabeth</hi> began her reigne Novemb. 17. <hi>an.</hi> 1558. and theſe were publiſhed <hi>ann.</hi> 1561.</note> ſoone after the reformation of Religion by Queene <hi>Eliſabeth, there were</hi> (we confeſs) <hi>certain proteſtations to be made, promiſed, and ſubſcribed by them that were afterwards to be admitted to any office, roome, or cure in any Church, or other place Eccleſiaſticall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But we conceive (beſides other differences to bee touched under another title) that neither theſe prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations are equivalent to ſuch a ſolemne oath, as now
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64411:18"/>is required of us, nor that there is ſuch need of it now, as there was of them at that time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> If it be ſaid, that in theſe times there is ſuch diviſion and diſtraction among us, that there is need to faſten us together by ſuch a ſacred bond as that of the Canon:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Wee thinke it reaſonable to reply, That neither the want of ſuch an oath was the cauſe of the diſtemper of the times, nor that the urging of it will be a convenient cure thereof; but rather the contrary: ſince there is more agreement betwixt peace and love, which may beſt be preſerved where offenſive things are not urged; then betwixt love and compulſion, eſpecially, if (as of this oath it is conceived) it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croach upon the conſcience, without any great need (as from them that require it) or without ſufficient ground to ſatisfie ſuch as ſhould receive it.</p>
                  <p>And wee ſee by the operation of it already, daily producing more and more diſlike of it, that it is not like to be a remedy againſt any malady already diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; but rather a meanes to exaſperate the diſeaſe (though this bee beſides the intention of them that propound it) whereof there was the leſſe need: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, as our learned and religious brethren the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines of Aberdene have obſerved,<note n="i" place="margin">Generall Demands of the Miniſters and Profeſſors of Aberdene, <hi>pag.</hi> 29.</note> 
                     <hi>There bee other meanes more effectuall for holding out of Popery</hi> (and ſo of any other unlawfull Innovation) <hi>in which we ought to confide more then in all the vowes &amp; promiſes of men: yea alſo, more then in all the united forces of all the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of this Land: to wit, diligent preaching and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the word, frequent prayer to God, humbling of our
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64411:18"/>ſelves before him, and amendment of our lives and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations, and arming our ſelves againſt our adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, by diligent ſearching of the Scriptures, whereby we may increaſe in the knowledge of the truth, and in abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to defend it againſt the enemies of it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe have been the chiefe meanes to advance both the Doctrine of truth, and the Diſcipline of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; and they will be the beſt meanes to hold them up ſtill: with them there will be no need, without them none aide by oaths of this kind.</p>
                  <p>There be ſome that ſay, This Oath was framed for tryall how men ſtand affected to the preſent govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and whether they be inclined to ſuch a change in the Eccleſiaſticall ſtate for Doctrine or Diſcipline, as tendeth to diſturbance of the civill government alſo, eſpecially to derogation from his Majeſties Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority: this is partly implyed in the Preface of the Oath, which beginneth thus; <hi>This preſent Synod, being deſirous to declare their ſincerity and conſtancy in the profeſsion of the Doctrine and Diſcipline eſtabliſhed in the Church of England, and to ſecure all men againſt ſuſpicion of revolt to Popery, or any other ſuperſtition, decrees, &amp;c.</hi>—and in this reſpect they conceive the Oath is of neceſſary uſe. To ſuch as thus plead for it, we thinke it meet to make this anſwer,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Concerning the venerable Synod, that though ſome perſons in it, being ſuſpected of unſound Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, of a Popiſh ſtraine, might doe very well to give all due and probable ſatisfaction, to acquit themſelves of that imputation (wherein we are perſwaded of ſome that they have been untruly traduced) yet wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this Oath not ſo pertinent to that purpoſe, as is
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64411:19"/>alledged; becauſe the third Canon, which inſiſteth much in the diſcovery and purſuit of Papiſts, and none elſe, importeth more oppoſition to Popery then this ſixth Canon doth, which requireth the Oath; ſince (as wee ſhall manifeſt in another place) it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth with a deeper charge againſt thoſe who are the greateſt Adverſaries of Popery, then againſt Papiſts themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, for the other part of the Oath concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diſcipline, or the government by Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, &amp;c. we apprehend no need of an Oath, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the ſincerity and conſtancy of the Synod in that reſpect; for who maketh doubt, but <hi>Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Deanes,</hi> and <hi>Archdeacons</hi> (who carry moſt ſway in all our Synods) are willing enough to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine their dignity and authority, and unwilling to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject either of them to Papall uſurpations. He is a man of little faith who will not take their bare word for that, without an Oath, or will require ſo much; for no reaſonable man can thinke otherwiſe of them, though they ſay nothing.</p>
                  <p>For we cannot imagine, if it were but for the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops owne ſake, that he (ſitting as Preſident of the Synod) would ever ſubmit to any uſurpations of the See of Rome; ſince hee knoweth, and would have others know from him (for hee hath publiſhed it in print) that the Pope hath acknowledged<note n="k" place="margin">Pope <hi>Urbane</hi> the ſecond, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted my worthy Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour Saint <hi>Anſelme,</hi> as his owne Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peere; and ſaid he was the Apoſtle and Patriarch of the other world. So Archbiſh. <hi>Laud</hi> in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of his conference with <hi>Fiſher, p.</hi> 171.</note> 
                     <hi>Anſelme, a worthy Predeceſſour of his in the See of Cant. for his owne compeere, the Apoſtle and Patriarch of the other world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:64411:19"/>
                  <p>And hee ſheweth himſelfe willing enough to take his Holineſſe at his word, and to keep him out from all command over the <hi>Britaine</hi> Church, alledging<note n="l" place="margin">Ibid. ex Guid. Pancirol.</note> 
                     <hi>that it was never ſubject to the See of Rome,</hi> having a Primate of its owne; and that Primate for the preſent is himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, for others, this Oath can be no good Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terion, to try mens ſincerity to either Doctrine or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline; for many things by divers may bee beleeved, liked, and preferred, before any other of that kind (ſo that they would bee loth to change them) and yet may they be unwilling to take an Oath for conſtancy to them.</p>
                  <p>For inſtance, wee beleeve kneeling at prayer to bee lawfull, laudable, and the beſt geſture wherein to preſent our devotions to God; yet wee would not be put to ſweare never to conſent to a conſtitution for ſtanding at prayer, ſince for it there is, firſt,<note n="m" place="margin">Mar. 11.25 Luk. 18.11.</note> Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; ſecondly, a Decree in the firſt<note n="n" place="margin">Conſona &amp; conveniens per omnes Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſias cuſtodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enda conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio eſt, ut ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes ad oratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem vota Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mino redda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus. <hi>Concil. Nicen.</hi> 1. <hi>Can.</hi> 20.</note> Nicen Councel; thirdly, a continued practice of it in the Church for<note n="o" place="margin">From before <hi>Tertullians</hi> time, untill <hi>Anſelme</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſh. of Cant.</note> many hundred of yeares together.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, many of thoſe who, in regard of the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold doubts involved in the Oath, are affraid to take it, have given better evidence of their ſincerity concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſtate, both eccleſiaſticall &amp; civill, then can be expected of moſt that take the oath (without any doubt or examination at all) &amp; if yet there be doubt of them, they may be put to the tryall of the firſt Canon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Kings Authority, and the eight made for preaching for conformity, both decreed by this laſt Synod, which may bee ſufficient for full ſatisfaction without an Oath; and yet they that dare not bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptory
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:64411:20"/>in every particular (in thoſe Canons deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined) may for all that bee as farre from all diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to trouble either Church or State with any Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, as they who would ſet the ſeale of an Oath to every line of them.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, though we doubt not, but divers who have taken the Oath bee very learned, grave, and godly perſons, and have done it (as they conceive) with due conſideration, and good conſcience; yet it cannot bee denied, but many may be too forward to ſweare, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any care or uſe of either: either out of <hi>hope</hi> to bee held very heartily affected to thoſe who have meanes to promote them (the hope whereof, as <hi>Aeneas Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi> obſerved, made more to adhere to the Pope, who gave preferments, then to the Councell, who had none to give) or out of <hi>feare</hi> of their diſ-favour, who have power to lay heavie preſſures upon them.</p>
                  <p>And in reſpect of ſuch the Oath is of no uſe or force, ſince the ſame affections (not regulated by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Religion) will incline (with the alteration of times) to quite contrary effects.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, ſo many of all ſorts, both of the Clergie and Laitie; yea, many of thoſe who hold Epiſcopall imparity the beſt government of the Church, and are no way addicted to the Presbyterian Diſcipline, diſlike this Oath ſo much, that howſoever this Canon may diſcover ſome difference betwixt thoſe, whoſe lot the wiſe man ſheweth may be alike (<hi>viz.</hi> betwixt <hi>him that ſweareth, and him that feareth an oath, Eccleſ.</hi> 9.2.) yet not that difference which may bee cauſe either of aſſurance of them that take it, to the doctrine or government of the Church,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64411:20"/>or of juſt jealouſie or ſuſpicion of them that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe it.</p>

For the ſaying of <hi>Hierome, That it is not a Church that hath not Sacerdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem,</hi> we that are Presbyters may as well conceive, that he meaneth a Presbyter, as he (a Biſhop) that he mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a Biſhop; and <hi>Hierome</hi> a Presbyter, as wee are, if he were alive, would (as wee verily beleeve) give ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence on our ſide: For,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it cannot bee denied, that though there bee more dignity in a Biſhop, the is more neceſſity of a Presbyter; that is, of one to officiate in preaching the Word, and adminiſtration of the Sacraments (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there is continuall uſe) then of a Biſhop to ordaine (if none could doe it but a Biſhop) which is required but ſometimes: and though a Biſhop performe the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:64411:26"/>ſame acts, yet hee doth them not as a Biſhop, but as a Presbyter.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if <hi>Hierome</hi> meant that there is no Church without an ordaining Biſhop, and that is his opinion (as his Lordſhip expounds him) it is his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, an uncharitable errour; which caſteth not parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Chriſtians onely, but many Orthodox Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches out of the communion of Saints, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently out of the ſtate of ſalvation; whereas, if ſome Biſhops had been as remote <hi>non</hi>-reſidents from their Biſhoprickes, as the Pope from Rome, when he reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at Avinion in France: or had medled no more with the Churches under their charges, then the Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian Prieſts did when they had Benefices in England, and knew onely the names of them, and received tythes from them; but did nothing for them, or in them: yet there might for all that bee true Churches, and ſalvation in them well enough. For, of what uſe is ſuch a Biſhop, or ſuch a Prieſt either to the being of a Church, or the well being or ſalvation of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if his words were true in that ſenſe (wherein his Lordſhip taketh them) it would be neceſſary there ſhould be as many Biſhops as Churches; and ſo, that Biſhops ſhould be rather Parochiall, then Dioceſan.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, if the place in <hi>Hierome</hi> be unpartially peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, it will not make much for the neceſſity of Biſhops: for <hi>Hierome</hi> (in his Dialogue againſt the Luciferians (whence the quotation is taken) ſpeaketh of one<note n="x" place="margin">Hilarius cum Diaconus de Eccleſia re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſerit—cum homo mortuus ſit, cum homine pariter interiit &amp; ſecta: quia poſt ſe nullum cleri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum potuit ordinare. <hi>Hieron. adverſ.

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. <hi>Hierome</hi> knew well enough, that of old (though it were otherwiſe in his time) Biſhops alone did not ordaine Church Miniſters, but the Presbytery with them, 1 <hi>Timoth.</hi> 4.14. if not without them; for many hold, that at that time there were no Prelaticall Biſhops above their brethren; &amp; even to this day there is a ſhadow of that ſociable power (in ordination of Miniſters of the Church of England) retained in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, by the impoſition of the hands of Presbyters with the Biſhop; and required by conſtitution in the 35. Canon of the yeare 1603. And ſome learned Papiſts are of opinion (though it come too neere the truth, to be common among them) that Biſhops may delegate their power, both of<note n="z" place="margin">Epiſcopum in ſua provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia poſſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittere ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plici ſacerdoti, quod conferat ſacramentum Confirmatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis. <hi>Martin.

                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:64411:27"/>
                  <p>Secondly, though (where there were Biſhops anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently and uſually) ordination was not conferred with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them; yet where there were none, without them it might be lawfully and effectually done (as we ſhall note in another place) and therefore no ſuch neceſſity either of them, or of ordination by them, as is preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. And though the over-high exaltation of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates hath depreſſed Presbyters ſo farre below the right and power of their order, that it is made (in ſome mens conceipts) a ſtrange thing, and a kind of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption in any caſe to take upon them the ordination of Miniſters; yet <hi>Hierome</hi> ſurely was not of their mind, when hee gave them the honour (which ſome Epiſcopall paraſites appropriate to Biſhops) to bee accounted the ſucceſſours of the holy Apoſtles; as he doth in the firſt of all his Epiſtles, which is written to <hi>Heliodorus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, from <hi>Hieromes</hi> words in this place wee may rather collect, that a Presbyter as well as a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop may ordaine, ſince hee denieth that faculty but to a Deacon; then that by the word <hi>Prieſt,</hi> a Biſhop muſt bee meant, and ordination peculiarly derived from him.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, howſoever where hee ſaith, that it is not a Church that hath not a Prieſt, hee is in reaſon to be underſtood not of one that hath power to make a Prieſt, but of a Prieſt already made: for, ſuch a one a particular Church cannot want; but of a Biſhop unto it there is no ſuch need.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, if <hi>Hierome</hi> in this place, being zealous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſchiſme, ſpoke ſomewhat too freely in favour of Biſhops, which yet is doubtfull (though more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:64411:27"/>that he ſpoke on the Presbyters ſide, then of the Biſhops.) It is certaine, that in other places (which wee ſhall obſerve afterward) hee expreſſeth himſelfe farre from ſuch fondneſſe of affection to Biſhops, as his Lordſhip deduceth out of his words. So much for the Teſtimonies of <hi>Hierome,</hi> wherein wee crave his Lordſhips patience and pardon for our boldneſſe, ſince his explication and application thereof for the neceſſity of Biſhops, to the being of a Church; and ſo (by conſequence) to ſalvation, hath put a neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie upon us, ſeriouſly to examine what hee ſaid and meant.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> There be ſome who, to aſſert a neceſſity of Diſcipline, ſay, that Diſcipline comprehendeth a preaching Miniſtry, and that's neceſſary to ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. There is neerer affinity betwixt Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Doctrine, then betwixt Preaching and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, which is exerciſed more in matter of<note n="a" place="margin">Quid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſet diſcipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam habere in converſatione, ſcientiam in praedicatione, niſi ad ſit boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas in inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione.

                  <p>Secondly, the neceſſity of Diſcipline here meant, is not in reſpect of a preaching Miniſtry, but of a ruling Epiſcopacy; as is evident by that we now obſerved of the Speech of the now Archbiſhop of Canterbury, the moſt authenticke Interpreter, becauſe the moſt Architechtonicall (if not the onely) compoſer of the late Canons.</p>

                  <p>There be degrees of neceſſity we grant, as where it is ſaid in the Catechiſme of the Communion booke, <hi>That there bee two Sacraments as generally neceſſary to ſalvation; Baptiſme, and the Lords Supper [onely two]</hi> Sacraments in a proper ſenſe, though in a large accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there may bee (as the Papiſts ſay) five more; as one ſaith,<note n="f" place="margin">D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Meyer</hi> his explanat. of the Catechiſm. <hi>q.</hi> 181. <hi>p.</hi> 494.</note> ſeventeen; as another,<note n="g" place="margin">D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Reynold</hi> in his confer. with <hi>Hart. pag.</hi> 523.</note> twenty ſeven <hi>[ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally neceſſary]</hi> that is, neceſſary for the ſtate of the Church in generall; without which it cannot be a true ſaving Church; not neceſſary for every member of it in particular, or neceſſary for particular perſons, if God give convenient opportunity for them: not that God cannot, or will not ſave without them, where his ordinance is by himſelfe denied, not by men deſpiſed or ſlighted. Thus we avoid the<note n="h" place="margin">In Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſmo duo Sacramenta neceſſaria ad ſalutem.

But thus wee cannot ſalve the neceſſity of Diſcipline: for, though Diſcipline bee neceſſary for the Church, yet the particular Diſcipline of our Church is not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to ſalvation; ſo that they cannot be true Churches, and ſalvation in them, which have it not.<note n="i" place="margin">Adverſarii nullam per Presbyteros or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinationem eſſe validam, niſi in caſu ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitatis: i quando deſunt omnino E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopi, aut deficiunt à fide. <hi>Ibid. p.</hi> 220.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p>In oppoſition to theſe, it may bee the meaning of the Oath is, That as for Doctrine, ſo for Diſcipline, our Church wanteth nothing that is needfull to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but becauſe (by ſuch an expreſſion) the Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of the Canon may ſeeme to aſſume that neceſſity of Epiſcopall preheminence (ſuch as it is in England and Ireland) which they condemne in the Diſcipline of Geneva, and other Reformed Churches, we feare a ſnare in theſe words of the Oath.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, we are bound to embrace the Decrees of an Apoſtolicall Councell, without all doubt or ſuſpicion of errour; but wee are not ſo to entertaine any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of men, ſince their time, whether ſingle, or
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:64411:30"/>aſſembled in Synods Dioceſan, Provinciall, Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, or Oecumenicall; ſince, as our Church reſolveth in the 21. Article, <hi>they may erre, and have erred in things pertaining to God:</hi> which the Apoſtles never did, nor could doe in any thing they taught, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, to be received by the Church.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Apoſtles leave the word <hi>[neceſſary]</hi> at large, to bee diſtributed by diſtinction and due ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication (according to the different nature of the things contained in their Apoſtolicall Decree.) Of which, though they ſay they are neceſſary, yet do they not ſay, they are neceſſary to ſalvation, as this Oath hath it, both concerning Doctrine and Diſcipline.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Apoſtles by their Decree required no Oath of ſuch as were ſubject unto them, as the ſixth Canon doth.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, they laid no new burthen on the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of Chriſtians, but rather tooke off a great part of the old, Ver. 28. but this Oath is a new burthen, and (if it ſhould be urged) the heavieſt (in reſpect of impoſition and penalty to ſome) that ever was laid on the Engliſh Church, ſince it left off to bee Romiſh: which the Impoſers (though prudent) might the leſſe apprehend, and take to heart, then their inferiours (in place and policy) becauſe it was not like to bee their owne caſe, to be troubled at the taking, or to bee cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, even to undoing, for the refuſall of the Oath; ſince they liked it ſo well themſelves, as to propound it to others.</p>
                  <p>If to mollifie the rigour of this combination of Doctrine and Diſcipline for neceſſity to ſalvation,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:64411:30"/>there bee found out other diſtinctions, then ſuch as have been touched, either concerning Diſcipline, or ſalvificall neceſſity, they may haply ſerve to ſalve an objection in Scholaſticall diſpute, rather then to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the conſcience againſt all doubt, ſo as is neceſſary to the due and ſafe taking of an Oath; though Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline in particular (as hath been ſhewed) be not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſalvation: and if it be not, it ſeemeth to be ſet in the Oath as an Aſſociat with the Doctrine (as to that effect) like <hi>Bibulus</hi> with <hi>Caeſar</hi> in the Conſulſhip, when<note n="*" place="margin">Non <hi>Bibulo</hi> quidquam nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, ſed <hi>Caeſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re</hi> factum eſt: Nam <hi>Bibulo</hi> fieri Conſule nil memini. <hi>Sueton. in Jul.

                  <p>It may bee the Synod thought that it was a better way, for preſervation of the Churches peace, to make no Decree concerning Arminian opinions; or that they were ſlandered, and made worſe then they are, though the Socinian be not: or that enough was done againſt the Arminians at the Synod at Dort; and (if any thing at all) a great deale too little againſt the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians: or that it was not for the honour of a Synod of Biſhops, &amp;c. to come after a Synod of meere Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters (one Biſhop onely excepted) and by their own Canons, as it were, to ſubſcribe to Presbyteriall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations.</p>
                  <p>And this laſt Reaſon haply prevaileth moſt with ſome Epiſcopall Divines, who (conceiving the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moning, preſiding, and voting in Synods by Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, to be a preſumptuous uſurpation of the peculiar

                  <p>But on the contrary, hee that hath taken upon him to analyze the Articles into ſeverall propoſitions, and to confirme them by Scripture, and otherwiſe (<hi>and this by allowance of publick Authority,</hi> as the title page of his booke doth teſtifie) ſetteth this Note upon that Article, <hi>Touching this Article, the greateſt matter</hi> (ſaith<note n="l" place="margin">Maſt. <hi>Rogers</hi> on the 35.

For the Deanes of Weſtminſter and Windſor (as<note n="o" place="margin">By the Biſh. of Cheſt. that now is.</note> wee have heard) have Epiſcopall Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, which other Cathedralls (for the moſt part) have not.

                  <p>Thirdly, the Juriſdiction of Deanes and Chapters may bee much augmented by Synodicall Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:

                  <p>It is more conſonant to reaſon to conceive, that they meant to have an acknowledgement, not onely that the Government <hi>de facto</hi> is indeed eſtabliſhed, but

                  <p>To this purpoſe we may bring in the ſaying of our Saviour, <hi>Lo, Lam with you to the end of the world, Mat.</hi> 28.20. which is not to be underſtood in perſon, but by aſſiſtance (for neither he, nor they his Apoſtles, to whom hee ſpake, were to bee in the world, untill the worlds end) and this aſſiſtance is divers: infallible, as to the Apoſtles, but ſufficient only to their ſucceſſors;

                  <head>THE REASON.</head>
                  <p>BEcauſe, firſt, for our Governours, we are bound in duty to yeeld our conſents to their lawfull Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, though with ſome alteration of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which we can have no heart to doe, if we have ſworne to the contrary.</p>

                  <p>Beſides, the chiefeſt of them hold the Diſcipline and Government by Biſhops immutable; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſome of them have ſaid, they would rather dye, then yeeld to an alteration of Epiſcopall Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: but wee beleeve it would bee more eaſie for a Logician to convince them, that Epiſcopacy is not of

That our not ſwearing is no preſent diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience; becauſe our conſciences cannot conſent to ſweare; and they that require the Oath would not have us to ſweare againſt our conſciences, nor againſt our good wills: for, one condition expreſſed in it is, <hi>That we doe it heartily, and willingly:</hi> nor do we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that, the premiſes duely conſidered, they would have us to ſweare.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, our not ſwearing in this caſe, is rather an obedience to our Superiours; becauſe we have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſworne to their Authority and Power for ſuch al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations, both for the preſent, and for their heires and ſucceſſours: and ſo our promiſſory Oath in this caſe (if we ſhould take it) would be with certaine prejudice to another mans right; <hi>and conſequently could not bee attended with juſtice: and the prejudice would bee more unjuſt, becauſe done to the right of publicke and ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Authority,</hi> as<note n="c" place="margin">

                  <head>THE REASON.</head>
                  <p>BEfore we render it, we profeſſe that we take this Doubt to be of a different kind from thoſe which hitherto wee have propoſed, ſince it is without the compaſſe both of the words and explication of the Oath, from whence all our ſcruples of conſcience hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto have been derived.</p>
                  <p>Yet becauſe we have heard this <hi>Quaere</hi> put forth by many, and not well anſwered by any, we crave leave to propoſe it, and to deliver ſome probable conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures upon it; leaving the certain Reſolution to thoſe who are better acquainted with the true cauſes thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> That exception of the ſonnes of Noblemen hath been excepted againſt by ſome for this reaſon:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> Becauſe their example in ſwearing to the Doctrine and Diſcipline of the Church, would bee of great moment to the maintenance of both: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they thinke it more meet, that they ſhould begin this ſacred atteſtation (whom others would bee moſt ready and forward to follow) then that they ſhould have a particular exception to free them from it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> If it be ſaid, When others take Oath, they take none, but make their proteſtations and promiſes <hi>in verbo honoris:</hi>

                  <p>That Archbiſhops and Biſhops are to take the Oath, who<note n="a" place="margin">The Kings large Declarat. of the Tumults in Scotl. <hi>p.</hi> 217.</note> take place of their right Honourable Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, both Earles and Lords; and ſo it can be no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour to their ſonnes, to doe as ſuch reverend, and ſo much honoured Prelates have done, eſpecially, ſince Biſhops have beene<note n="b" place="margin">Epiſcopi &amp; Regis verbum ſcu affirmatio ſine juramento fit irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragabile. <hi>Concil.

                     </note> 
                     <hi>The word of a Prieſt was rated to the Teſtimonies of twelve of the Laity.</hi> But the priviledge of the Nobility yet remaineth, and that of the Clergy now is loſt: which may give us juſt occaſion to examine, whether they have not beene more true to their honour, then moſt of us to the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of our ſacred Profeſſion; and if they have, they may bee priviledged from the taking of this Oath, though we be not.</p>
                  <p>It is probable alſo, that they were exempted upon eſpeciall reſpects, both of <hi>ingenuity</hi> and <hi>prudence:</hi> of <hi>ingenuity,</hi> by thoſe Clergy men, who were bound to all honourable obſervance of ſuch noble Families, as had been meanes to preferre them; and of <hi>prudence,</hi> in preventing a repulſe to their purpoſe: for it was not like that the Nobility would ſuffer their ſonnes to bee
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:64411:67"/>entangled with ſuch an Oath, as is prejudiciall to the conſcience: and (as many Lawyers alledge) to the obedience due to his moſt excellent Majeſty, and his Royall Succeſſours.</p>
                  <p>That which we reade in the Conference at Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pton Court, gives us juſt occaſion ſo to conceive; which is, <hi>That when there was ſpeech of the</hi>

                     <hi>Oath</hi> ex officio, <hi>one of the Lords compared it to the courſe of the Spaniſh Inquiſition; and if the Nobility had diſtaſted it, and renounced it, it would have given the greater en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour agement to others to ſtand out againſt it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Howſoever, Gods providence hath moſt wiſely or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered their exemption from ſwearing; for, ſince the Nobility are not required to take this Oath, their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and endeavour to have the aggrievance of it remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from others (as their petition to his Majeſty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Parliament ſheweth) doth evidence their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, religious, and charitable minds towards all ſuch, as by their mediation may bee ſecured from ſuffering in their conſciences by taking, or in their liberties and eſtates for refuſall thereof.</p>
                  <p>For which pious compaſſion many thouſands, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially we of the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> are deeply obliged to praiſe God for their Honours, and to pray to him for his vigilant providence and potent protection, both over them and their honourable Progeny.</p>

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:64411:68"/>take the Oath, onely Clergy men are upon their refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall of it to be puniſhed: and that, though gradually, yet with as much ſeverity as any Eccleſiaſticall Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority can inflict: for, they within three moneths are to be put out both of their miniſtry and means; while all others (though they refuſe the Oath as well as they) are by the Canon not to bee the worſe for their refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall.</p>
                  <p>It may bee, the Biſhops may prohibit ſome to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe Phyſicke, others to teach Schoole, that will not ſweare; and they that will not take the Oath, perhaps ſhall take no orders at their hands: and for Regiſters, Actuaries, and Proctors of their Courts, if they refuſe it, it may be they will refuſe them, and put them out of their offices; but the Canon concludeth nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any one, but Eccleſiaſticks, eſpecially Beneficed Preachers; which, whether it may more incline ſuch to love, or feare thoſe who lay theſe heavie penalties upon them, there is none ſo ſimple, but may ſoone perceive; nor is any ſo wiſe, as in this to ſee either the compaſſion of the reverend Prelates, as their fathers; or the charity of inferiour Clerks, as their brethren: for, by this Canon they are neceſſarily caſt upon one part of this dangerous <hi>Dilemma:</hi>

                  <p>If they take the Oath (beſides the ſcruples of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience before obſerved) their taking of it (as we have touched before) muſt bee recorded by a Notary pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke; and then, if they doe any thing, which they that are their Judges will call a breach of the Oath they have taken, they may bee called in queſtion for the crime of perjury.</p>

                     <hi>Thomas Archbiſhop of Canterbury, was at a Councell (held at Northampton) accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and condemned of perjury; becauſe hee had ſworne to the Engliſh cuſtomes, and had not obſerved them.</hi> And it is an eaſie matter (out of an Oath of ſuch copious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, as this of the ſixth Canon) to frame an accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation againſt him that hath taken it; eſpecially, if what lieth in ambuſh under the <hi>&amp;c.</hi> bee brought into the charge: hereof our feare may bee the more; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome of us have obſerved, how forward ſome of our ſuperiours have beene to lay an imputation of perjury upon the inferiour Clergy; becauſe (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken the Oath of Canonicall obedience) they have not been ſo ready (as they would have them) to performe what they impoſed by uncanonicall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
                  <p>On the contrary, if they take not the Oath, and thereupon the penalty of the Canon bee laid upon them, they muſt take leave of their Paſtorall charges; and no more be allowed to feed their Flockes, nor to be clothed with their fleece: which is like (in reſpect of many Pariſhes) to be a great calamity both to the Paſtors and People.</p>

                  <p>

                  <p>Firſt, Is it any good Argument, that becauſe they have ſworne againſt the Prelacy, that we muſt ſweare for it? men by law are not allowed to take contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory Oaths; and if there bee any Authority in their example, it may ſerve rather to make us doubtfull, then reſolute to ſweare: though wee thinke it might bee more reaſonable to require Geneva to receive ſome Doctrines from us, then wee Diſcipline from them.</p>
                  <p>As concerning the Sabbath, they of Geneva might have learned founder Inſtruction from our Homilies, then wee from<note n="m" place="margin">Calv. Inſtit. lib. <hi>2.</hi> ch. <hi>8.</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, to live in obedience to ſuch orders (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the exerciſe of their Religion, and the forme of Eccleſiaſticall Government) as the true and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

                  <p>Fourthly, as they made no doubt of the lawfulneſſe of the Oath, ſo were they not urged unto it by any commination of danger: and ſo their ſwearing might be with a free will, not mixed either with reluctancie of conſcience, or with feare of penalty.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, the Diſcipline of Geneva is ſaid to bee a<note n="o" place="margin">The Lord Archb. of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury in his Speech in the Starre-chamb.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p>If ſo, they of Geneva had need of an Oath, to give ſtrength to their new invented Government; and
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:64411:72"/>we (without an Oath) might be confident of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of ours, according to the ſound reſolution of the renowned Doctor of the Law, <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> in the fifth of the Acts of the Apoſtles: <hi>If this counſell, or this worke</hi> (ſaid hee) <hi>be of men, it will come to nought; but if it be of God, you cannot overthrow it, leſt haply yee be found even to fight againſt God,</hi> Act. 5. v. 38, 39.</p>
                  <p>Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the ſeventh, upon this ground (though miſtaken as in application to the Papacy) grew very confident againſt the feare of a future Councell, as the Authour of the Hiſtory of the Councell of Trent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth, in theſe words:<note n="ſ" place="margin">Pope <hi>Clem.</hi> Hiſt.

                     <hi>There was a fame ſpread, the Pope would have no Councell, for feare his Authority ſhould be reſtrained: areaſon which maketh no impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion at all in him, having his Authority immediatly from Chriſt, with promiſe, that the gates of Hell ſhould not prevaile againſt it: and the experience of former times hath ſhewed, that the Papall Authority hath never been diminiſhed by any Councell; but according to the words of our Lord, the Fathers have ever confeſſed it to be abſolute and unlimited, as it is indeed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In word rather, or in conceipt at the beſt: and it was conceipt, and no more, that upheld his heart againſt all oppoſitions of his power; And our reverend Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates have ſo much leſſe cauſe to feare their ſtate (though it be not ſupported by ſwearing) as they have more warrant to build their hopes upon the oraculous ſentence of that famous Doctor.</p>
                  <p>The other particular more eſpecially reſpecteth the piety of the people, whoſe conſciences are like to be carefully guided by ſuch Divines, as are chary of their owne. Of whoſe Miniſtry (if they ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived)
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:64411:73"/>it is not like, that generally there would bee found a ſupply to countervaile the loſſe of their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious labours, and exemplary practice, the two chiefe helps to holineſſe of life: and we conceive it a point of <hi>Piety,</hi> and a caſe of conſcience, worthy of the grave and godly conſideration of the reverend Prelates to reſolve, whether, becauſe in this caſe wee dare not ſweare, God will reject our ſervice in his Sanctuary; if not, why ſhould they?</p>
                  <p>The ſaying of <hi>Wickliffe</hi> (though condemned as he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall in the Popiſh Councell of Conſtance) may (as we conceive, with a little correction) bee made a very Orthodox poſition, and pertinent to this purpoſe: Thus,<note n="t" place="margin">Nullus Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latus debet ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quem excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municare, niſi priùs ſciat ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum à Deo <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic.</hi> 11. <hi>Wickl.
